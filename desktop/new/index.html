            On planet Earth, there are a bunch of programmers. But, if you compare the numbers to other jobs, this 'bunch' of programmers isn't that big anymore. In fact, it's <i>very</i> tiny. The biggest reason is that a lot of people think it is only for super-duper-nerds. It isn't! We think <i>everyone</i> (including <i><b>you</b></i>!) should learn how to program a program. So how do we get people started with programming? We created the <b>most simple</b> programming language you can imagine! Convinced yet? Take a look around our website, for downloads and other cool stuff!
